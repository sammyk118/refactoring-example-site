# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This project is about making Horiseon's code base meet accessibility standards. That means that I modified the source code to contain semantic elements, have a logical structure, have alt attributes for image elements, and have a sequential order for heading attributes.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- GitHub

## What I did
- gave the webpage a proper title
- replaced div elements and classes with semantic html elements. 
- replaced classes that were only used once with ids.
- added alt tags to images
- in CSS, consolidated identifiers that had identical attributes
```css
/* consolidated identical attributes */
#search-engine-optimization, #online-reputation-management, #social-media-marketing {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
    height: 300px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #0072bb;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```
- changed the order in css to make logical sense
